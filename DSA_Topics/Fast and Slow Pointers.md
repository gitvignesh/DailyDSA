We can use the above information to implement a Linked List version of the two pointer technique that we already discussed in the arrays chapter. The idea here is very similar, except we are not moving the pointers towards each other, per se. Rather, we can have both of the pointers start at the same location or even different locations and then move the pointers at different speeds. Usually there is a `fast` pointer and a `slow` pointer. The `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer.

Q: Find the middle of a linked list.

Q: Determine if a Linked List has a cycle.

Q: Determine if a Linked List has a cycle and return the head.
