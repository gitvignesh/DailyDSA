Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently or in a non-blocking manner. In asynchronous programming, tasks can start, run, and complete independently of each other, without waiting for previous tasks to complete. This approach contrasts with synchronous programming, where tasks are executed sequentially, one after another. To understand this we need to first understand what is [[Process & Thread]]
### Key Concepts of Asynchronous Programming:
1. **Non-Blocking Operations**: Asynchronous operations do not block the execution of other tasks. Instead of waiting for a task to complete before moving on to the next one, the program can initiate tasks and continue executing other code or tasks concurrently.
2. **Callbacks or Promises**: Asynchronous programming typically involves using callbacks (functions that are invoked when a task completes) or promises/futures (objects that represent the result of an asynchronous operation) to handle the completion of tasks asynchronously.
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous programming often employs event-driven architecture, where tasks are initiated by events or messages, and handlers (callbacks) are triggered when events or tasks complete or encounter errors.
4. **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Asynchronous programming facilitates concurrency, allowing multiple tasks to be initiated and processed concurrently. This concurrency can lead to improved performance and responsiveness in applications, especially when dealing with tasks like network requests, file I/O, or user interface updates.
